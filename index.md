# PaletteBot Documentation
PaletteBot is a Discord bot written in Visual C#. It was designed with color assignment in mind, but it can do way more than that.
This bot is in alpha, so expect bugs and incomplete features.

Also, this documentation is very incomplete, therefore you might not be able to rely on it right now.
